I feel pretty good on Arrays so far. I have had a little exposer to them already through the Trycoding workshops that I have gone to. Those classes where absolutely worth the $10! Also with Ruby most of the methods do what you think they will ex. Reverse, it reverse the arrays.

I don't have any questions yet with Arrays. I know that there are more than just the few that we have learned. It will just be making sure that I am using the correct verbage when trying to talk about coding. All the repetition has also helped the remembering which array is which.
